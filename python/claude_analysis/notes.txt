Claude Analysis Directory - Cleaned Up
======================================

This folder contains experimental analysis and optimization attempts for the GOPS solver.

MAIN FILES:
-----------
1. consolidated_tests.py - Run this for all compression strategy tests and final report
2. profile_test.py - Profile the main solver to identify bottlenecks  
3. benchmark_lp.py - Benchmark LP solver implementations
4. analyze_states.py - Basic state space analysis by n

EXPERIMENTAL SOLVERS (not faster than main):
-------------------------------------------
- solver_fast.py - Attempt at reduced cache overhead
- solver_v2.py - Simplified solver with inline saddle point
- solver_v3.py - Attempt at restructuring prize averaging
- analytical_solver.py - Analytical 2x2 game solver (for small games)
- check_lp.py - Verify LP solver correctness

KEY FINDINGS (from consolidated_tests.py):
-----------------------------------------
VALID compressions:
  - GCD normalization: ~1.02x (minimal)
  - Scale invariance: confirmed
  - Outcome mapping: ~1.4x overall (3-4x at shallow, 1x at deep depths)

INVALID compressions:
  - Sorted prizes without prizeIndex: prizeIndex matters!
  - Compressed mapping (win/tie/loss counts): loses info

BOTTOM LINE:
The ~1.4x from outcome mapping is the best valid compression found.
For n=13, this doesn't change feasibility.
The exponential growth is fundamental to the game structure.

To run all tests: py consolidated_tests.py
