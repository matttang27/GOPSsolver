# Repository Agent Rules

## Archived Code
- Treat `old_python_solver/` as archived and read-only.
- Do not edit, refactor, or add tests for files under `old_python_solver/**`.
- If historical context is needed, read-only access is allowed.

## Active Code Areas
- Active solver and tooling work happens in `solver/`, `ai/`, `tests/`, and CI config under `.github/`.
