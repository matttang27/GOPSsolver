- What are some simple patterns we can deduct? 
- How do simple strategies (random, deterministic) fare against NE? 
- Create an exploitative AI that is based on NE. 
- Now try NE bots which are purposely biased (for example, plays more 10s when they see 10s, otherwise NE), and compare performance against NE and exploitative 
- try other forms of rewards 
- a bot that is rewarded only for winning prizes with slim margins 
- create a playable site where you can play against various bots, and analyze NE strategy.
